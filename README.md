javascript geometry and topology tools

This is a small set of geometry tools I had written around a years ago for a small project, as well as a basic html5 renderer. I opened this repo in case I am back in the mood. Once upon a time I had written a lot of examples but now only one survives here http://codentonic.net/2013/04/21/cad-implementation-using-the-javascript-based-topology-library/
